# Image-Deonising

In this Project four types of noises (Salt and Pepper, Gaussian, Speckle and poission noise) have been added to input image.
It is observed that all noise causes degradation in the image quality which results in loss ofinformation.
In this analysis, 7 different Filters are used for a picture to restore them and compared which filter works best of a particular noise using PSNR.
